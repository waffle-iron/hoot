## What's left to do

### College Search implementation
For this we need to implement ElasticSearch which means running a separate server, which is something I was hoping to avoid by using firebase. Fun!

- ElasticSearch
- [Flashlight](https://github.com/firebase/flashlight)
- [bonsai](https://bonsai.io)
- [heroku](https://heroku.com)

We could also look into using something on GCP if it'd work with firebase. But I can't see anything.

### Student Representatives
We need a third type of user account for user representatives. These account
have a dashboard with a series of chats, and are assigned to individual
schools. They also need to be manually verified, like institute accounts.

### Data Gathering
Set up institute accounts and gather data
